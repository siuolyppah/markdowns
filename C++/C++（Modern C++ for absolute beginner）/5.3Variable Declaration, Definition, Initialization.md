- Introducing a name into a current scope is called a ==declaration==.

  We are letting the world know there is a name.

  ```cpp
  int main()
  {
      char c;
      int x;
      double d;
  }
  ```

- If there is an initializer for an object present, then we call it an ==initialization==.

  ```cpp
  int main()
  {
      int x = 123;
      int y{ 123 };
      int z = { 123 };
  }
  ```

- ==Definition==, it is a declaration followed by an initialization (for variables) followed by a semicolon. The definition is also a declaration. A variable definition is setting a value in memory for a name.

  ```cpp
  int main(){
      char c = 'a';
      int x = 123;
      double d = 456.78;
  }
  ```
