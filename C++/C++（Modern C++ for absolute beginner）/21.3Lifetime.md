- *The ==lifetime==* of an object is <u>the time</u> an object <u>spends in memory</u>.

  The lifetime is <u>determined by</u> a so-called <u>*storage duration*</u>（存储期）.

- Four kinds of ==storage duration==:

  1. automatic:

     memory for an object is automatically allocated at the beginning of a block and deallocated when the code block ends.

     >This is also called a stack memory; objects are allocated on the stack.

  2. static:

     When an object declaration is prepended with a static specifier, it means the storage for a static object is allocated when the program starts and deallocated when the program ends.

  3. dynamic:

     memory for an object is manually allocated and manually deallocated.

  4. thread (local)
