# Linux architecture

- On the top layer, there are user applications, processes, compilers, and tools. This layer (which runs in a user space) communicates with the Linux kernel (which runs in kernel space) through system calls.
- System libraries: These are a set of functions through which an application can interact with the kernel.
- Kernel: This component contains the core of the Linux system. Among other
  things, it has the scheduler, networking, memory management, and filesystems.
- Kernel modules: These contain pieces of kernel code that still run in kernel space but are fully dynamic (in the sense that they can be loaded and unloaded with the running system). They typically contain device drivers, kernel code that is specific to a particular hardware module implementing a protocol, and so on. One huge advantage of the kernel modules is that users can load them without rebuilding the kernel.



# Shell

A shell is a command interpreter that receives commands in an input, redirects them to GNU/Linux, and returns back the output.



# Users

- Create a user:

  ```sh
  root@90f5b4545a54:~# adduser spacex --ingroup developers
  Adding user `spacex' ...
  Adding new user `spacex' (1001) with group `developers' ...
  Creating home directory `/home/spacex' ...
  Copying files from `/etc/skel' ...
  New password:
  Retype new password:
  passwd: password updated successfully
  Changing the user information for spacex
  Enter the new value, or press ENTER for the default
  Full Name []: Onorato
  Room Number []:
  Work Phone []:
  Home Phone []:
  Other []:
  Is the information correct? [Y/n] Y
  ```

- Switch user:

  ```sh
  root@90f5b4545a54:~# login spacex
  Password:
  ```

- Updating a user's password:

  ```sh
  spacex@90f5b4545a54:~$ passwd
  Changing password for spacex.
  ```

- Assigning a user to a group:

  ```sh
  root@90f5b4545a54:~# usermod -a -G testers spacex
  ```

- Removing a user:

  ```sh
  root@90f5b4545a54:~# userdel -r spacex
  ```

  >The -r option indicates to remove the spacex home directory and mail spool.

- Show the list of groups to which the current user belongs:

  ```sh
  spacex@90f5b4545a54:~$ groups
  developers testers
  ```

- create a group:

  ```sh
  groupadd group-name
  ```

- `chmod`:

  ```sh
  chmod g+w conf.json
  chmod 751 conf.json
  ```

  >The types of users are as follows: u (for user), o (for others), a (for all), and g (for
  >group), and the permissions flag can be x, w, and r, as explained previously.

  >wxr: 111 = 7
  >w-r: 101 = 5
  >--r:  001 = 1



# Using a makefile to compile and link a program

A makefile is a file that describes the relationship among the sources of a program used by the `make` utility to <u>build (compile and link) the target goal</u> (executable, shared object, and more).

- hello.cpp:

  ```cpp
  #include <iostream>
  int main()
  {
      std::cout << "Hello World!" << std::endl;
      return 0;
  }
  ```

- Makefile:

  ```makefile
  CC = g++
  
  all: hello
  hello: hello.o
  	${CC} -o hello hello.o
  hello.o: hello.cpp
  	${CC} -c hello.cpp
  clean:
  	rm hello.o hello
  ```

  

A typical makefile has the following content:

1. The first rule consists of a target called all, and a prerequisite called hello.
   There is no command for this rule.
2. The second rule consists of a target called hello. It has a prerequisite on
   hello.o and a command to link: g++.
3. The third rule has a target called hello.o, a prerequisite on hello.cpp, and a
   command to compile: g++ -c hello.cpp.
4. The last rule has a clean target with a command to remove all the
   hello and hello.o executables. This forces the recompilation of the files.

For any rule, if any of the source files change, then the command defined is executed.



# GDB

- hello.cpp

  ```cpp
  #include <iostream>
  int main()
  {
      int x = 10;
      x += 2;
      std::cout << "Hello World! x = " << x << std::endl;
      return 0;
  }
  ```

  > 编译链接它：
  >
  > ```sh
  > root@bffd758254f8:~/Chapter1# make
  > g++ -c hello.cpp
  > g++ -o hello hello.o
  > ```

- use gdb:

  ```sh
  root@bffd758254f8:~/Chapter1# gdb hello
  ```

  > 会提示No debugging symbols found in hello.

- 在编译时，引入debug symbols:

  ```sh
  g++ -g -c hello.cpp
  ```



gdb的用法：

- visualizing the code we're going to debug:

  ```gdb
  (gdb) l
  1 #include <iostream>
  2 int main()
  3 {
  4 int x = 10;
  5 x += 2;
  6 std::cout << "Hello World! x = " << x << std::endl;
  7 return 0;
  8 }
  ```

- set a breakpoint:

  ```gdb
  (gdb) b 5
  Breakpoint 1 at 0x1169: file hello.cpp, line 5.
  ```

- run the program:

  ```gdb
  (gdb) r
  Starting program: /root/Chapter1/hello
  ```

  > Once started, GDB <u>will automatically stop at any breakpoint</u> hit by the process flow.

- proceed step by step:

  ```gdb
  (gdb) n
  6 std::cout << "Hello World! x = " << x << std::endl;
  ```

- step into(If the current command is a function, it steps into the function):

  ```gdb
  s
  ```

- run the p command (short for print), which prints the content of a variable.

  ```gdb
  (gdb) p x
  $1 = 12
  ```

- Prints the call stack(backtrace)

  ```gdb
  bt
  ```

- delete breakpoint

  ```gdb
  d 1
  ```

  >removes <u>the first</u> breakpoint set.



# Processes and Threads

- A process in Linux is defined by the task_struct structure defined in the sched.h header file. On the other hand, a thread is defined by the thread_info structure in the thread_info.h header file.

- One aspect to keep in mind on Linux is that it doesn't differentiate between processes and threads. ==A thread is just like a process that <u>shares some resources</u> with some other processes==.



一些控制进程和线程的命令：

- `ps`:shows the processes, attributes, and other parameters in the
  current system:

  ```sh
  root@5fd725701f0f:/# ps u
  USER PID %CPU %MEM VSZ RSS TTY STAT START TIME COMMAND
  root 1 0.0 0.1 4184 3396 pts/0 Ss 17:20 0:00 bash
  root 18 0.0 0.1 5832 2856 pts/0 R+ 17:22 0:00 ps u
  ```

- `kill`:kill a process.

  ```sh
  root@5fd725701f0f:/# kill -9 PID
  ```

  

# Handling Linux code error

- open_file.c:

  ```c
  #include <fcntl.h>
  #include <stdio.h>
  #include <stdlib.h>
  #include <errno.h>
  #include <string.h>
  int main(int argc, char *argv[])
  {
      int fileDesc = open("myFile.txt", O_RDONLY);
      if (fileDesc == -1)
      {
          fprintf(stderr, "Cannot open myFile.txt .. error: %d\n",
                  fileDesc);
          fprintf(stderr, "errno code = %d\n", errno);
          fprintf(stderr, "errno meaningn = %s\n", strerror(errno));
          exit(1);
      }
  }
  ```
